# Cpp-Sudoku-Game

Simple C++ program with old graphics.h library. That was an old project which I uploaded pretty late here.
Even if you fail to apply graphics.h, you can reference the algorithm implementation.
WxWidget, QT or NSFW is recommended.


Algorithm implementation mainly focus on getting new puzzles in the possibilities of 9 Factorial.

Solving it, is pretty simple via backtracking algorithm, where you can find plenty of tutorials and repos for solver!
